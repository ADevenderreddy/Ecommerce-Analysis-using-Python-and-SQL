# Ecommerce Analysis using Python and SQL

## Project Overview
This project involves the analysis of an ecommerce dataset using **Python** and **MySQL Workbench**. The goal is to extract valuable insights by establishing a connection between Python and MySQL, using libraries like `mysql-connector`. SQL queries are used to manage and manipulate data, while Python is used for further analysis and visualization.

## Features
- Established connection to **MySQL Workbench** using Python's `mysql-connector` library.
- Executed complex SQL queries for data extraction and transformation.
- Performed data analysis on the retrieved data.
- Visualized key insights using Python libraries.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
  - `mysql-connector`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib` (for visualization)
- **MySQL Workbench**
